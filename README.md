#### This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern for [The Sparks Foundation](https://internship.thesparksfoundation.info/).
  
  - Internship Category - Data Science and Business Analytics
  - Internship Duration - 1 Month ( October-2020 )
  - Internship Type - Work from Home

 In this internship, we were provided a total of 8 Tasks and I was able to successfully complete 6 tasks. 
  
  
 ### TASK1 - Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
  
  1. Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. 
  2. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
  3. You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool 
  4. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
  5. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day? 

  
 ### TASK2 - Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)
  
  1. From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters 
and represent it visually. 
  2. Use R or Python or perform this task
  3. Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

 ### TASK3 - Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail (Level - Beginner)
  
  1. Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’ 
  2. As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit. 
  3. What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data? 
  4. You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS).
  5. Dataset: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl
  
  
 ### TASK4 - Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism (Level - Intermediate)
  
  1. Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’ 
  2. As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism. 
  3. What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA? 
  4. You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS).
  5. Dataset: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5
  
 ### TASK5 - Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports (Level - Advanced)
  1. Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’.
  2. As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team. 
  3. Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products. 
  4. You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS).
  5. Dataset: https://bit.ly/34SRn3b
  
 ### TASK6 - Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm (Level - Intermediate)
  1. Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 
  2. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to 
predict the right class accordingly.
